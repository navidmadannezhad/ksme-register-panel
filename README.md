# ksme-register-panel
A registration panel for Karaj Society of Mechanical Engineering (KSME)

I used Nuxt js and Django rest framework to build this single page registration web app.

## So why is there a laravel backend? 
Nice question! What does laravel have to do with a DRF backend?
The reason is, after I finished the project and went on to buy a python web hosting for it, I just realized that new hostings are 3 times more expensive than I thought!
On the other half, I had a old laravel web hosting, which was not being used for months.
So I decided to create a laravel version of this DRF project, in such a annoying way!

Anyway, enjoy the codes!
